# Introduction #

Below is a list of sites I have currently downloaded and tested to work. Since I mostly download videogame-related sites (especially retro-games), expect those to be most of what you'll see.


# Working, Default Config #

This is the gold standard. Sites that require no "hacks" for most functionality. Some hacks may still be required for certain things (e.g. the metaHack and selectHack), but CSS & Javascript should work without these.

  * www.psypokes.com
  * www.serebii.net
  * mother3.fobby.net
  * browsers.garykeith.com
  * davidwonn.kontek.net
  * www.spriters-resource.com

# Working, Redirect Hacks #

Really no avoiding these, though a good demonstration of the functionality.

  * www.rpgclassics.com
  * www.lostlevels.org - Only required for small amounts of CSS backgrounds. Otherwise, works perfectly.

# Working, Content Hacks #

These require content hacks due to some glitch or another. Hopefully, these will no longer be required in the future.

  * www.jaytheham.com

# Working, Parsing Hacks #

These require parsing hacks, and there likely isn't a better route. They include "scriptHacks", "dirtyAttributes", and others.

  * www.blue-reflections.net
  * www.upokecenter.com - This one has some really funky Javascript that I've used to try to shape the Javascript parser. It's been interesting.
